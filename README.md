# ACS F1 Classification Model

The ACS-F1 dataset is a collection of appliance consumption signatures created with low-cost plug-based sensors. It contains measurements from approximately 100 household appliances across 10 categories, recorded under different operating conditions to capture diverse usage patterns. Each appliance includes two one-hour sessions, with data such as power, current, voltage, and frequency. The dataset is primarily intended for research in appliance recognition and energy disaggregation tasks. Further details about the dataset are available [here](https://icosys.ch/acs-f1).

As an initial approach, a GRU-based neural network was implemented to classify appliance signatures from the ACS-F1 dataset. The model processes sequences of 360 time steps with 6 features through a GRU layer with 256 units, applies global max pooling, and produces predictions across 10 categories via a softmax layer. To address the limited dataset size, additional samples were generated by augmenting the signals with Gaussian noise, improving the model's generalization. Trained using categorical cross-entropy and the Nadam optimizer, the model achieved an accuracy and F1-score of 85% on the test set.

For alternative evaluation, the same GRU-based model was trained and tested using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, with data augmentation applied to the training folds. This setup provided a more robust assessment of generalization performance, resulting in a mean test accuracy of 74.5%.

The project was created to fulfill the requirements of the Artificial Intelligence course in the Computer Science degree program. The project received a grade of 5.0 on a scale from 2 to 5.
